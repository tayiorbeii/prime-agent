# MCP Integrations

Connect external services (Linear, Notion, …) to Prime Agent over the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

Consistent with Prime Agent's single-tool design, MCP integrations are **not**
exposed as new agent tools. Each integration is a [Python-backed skill](skills.md)
that the model imports and calls from the IPython kernel:

```python
import linear
issues = await linear.list_issues(team="Engineering")
```

HTTP MCP integrations run inside the kernel via the official `mcp` Python SDK.
The host handles interactive login (browser OAuth) and minting/refreshing
credentials in `auth.json`, but does not proxy ordinary HTTP tool calls.

Local stdio integrations are different: the host owns their sidecar processes,
including command, environment, working directory, startup, and shutdown. The
kernel receives only a host bridge for tool discovery and calls; it never spawns
the sidecar or receives its process configuration.

## Using a built-in integration

Built-in integrations (Linear, Notion) ship **disabled**. Logging in enables them:

- Open `/login`, switch to **MCP Connections**, pick the integration, and
  complete OAuth in the browser. `/mcp login <name>` does the same from the CLI.
- Once connected, the integration's skill becomes visible to the model and is
  auto-imported into the kernel.
- `/mcp` lists integrations and connection status; `/mcp logout <name>`
  disconnects.

Credentials are stored once in `~/.prime/agent/auth.json` under `mcp:<name>`.
HTTP enablement is derived from valid credentials (or a configured bearer-token
environment variable). Set `enabled: false` to explicitly disable any user
server, including a local stdio server.

## How a call works

The tool set is defined by the **server**, not the skill, so discover before you
call — don't assume tool names or arguments:

```python
import linear

# 1. Discover available tools
for tool in await linear.list_tools():
    print(tool["name"], "-", tool["description"])

# 2. Inspect a tool's argument schema
help(linear.list_issues)        # populated once list_tools() has run

# 3. Call it; keyword args match the tool's JSON Schema
result = await linear.list_issues(team="Engineering")
```

- Every tool is an `async` method — always `await`.
- Results are already-parsed Python: a `dict` for structured output, a string for
  text, or a list of content blocks otherwise. No need to `json.loads` them.
- A tool whose name isn't a valid Python identifier (e.g. Notion's `notion-search`)
  is called via the escape hatch: `await notion.call_tool("notion-search", {...})`.
- A call against an HTTP integration with no credentials raises `NotEnabled`
  (telling the user to `/mcp login`); explicitly disabled integrations raise
  `Disabled`; a tool that returns an error raises `McpToolError`. Local stdio
  integrations do not use `auth.json` and are enabled by their settings entry.

## Authoring your own integration

An integration is a [Python skill package](skills.md#python-backed-skills) whose
module subclasses `McpIntegration`. The built-in `linear` / `notion` packages are
the reference implementations.

### 1. Declare the server

Add it under `mcpServers` in `~/.prime/agent/settings.json` (or project
`.prime/agent/settings.json`):

```jsonc
// ~/.prime/agent/settings.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acme": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.acme.com/mcp",
      "oauth": true
    }
  }
}
```

HTTP server fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `type` | Must be `"http"` |
| `url` | The MCP endpoint |
| `oauth` | `true` to use the browser OAuth flow (requires the server to support dynamic client registration) |
| `bearerTokenEnvVar` | Name of an env var holding a static bearer token, instead of OAuth |
| `headers` | Extra static HTTP headers sent on every request |
| `enabled` | Set `false` to force-disable even when credentials exist |
| `enabledTools` / `disabledTools` | Optional tool allow/deny lists |

Local `"stdio"` servers are launched lazily by the host, not by the Python
kernel. Their command, arguments, environment, and working directory remain
host-side; the kernel uses a host bridge for `list_tools` and `call_tool`.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `type` | Must be `"stdio"` |
| `command` | Executable passed directly to the subprocess (no shell is used) |
| `args` | Optional argv arguments |
| `cwd` | Optional working directory, resolved relative to the active workspace |
| `env` | Optional child-process environment additions |
| `enabled` | Set `false` to prevent launch and tool calls |
| `enabledTools` / `disabledTools` | Optional host-side tool allow/deny lists |

### 2. Ship the skill package

Create a skill directory (any [skills location](skills.md#locations), e.g.
`~/.prime/agent/skills/acme/`) with the standard Python-skill layout:

```
acme/
  SKILL.md
  pyproject.toml
  src/acme/__init__.py
```

`pyproject.toml` (depends on `mcp`, `httpx`, and `prime-agent-runtime`):

```toml
[project]
name = "prime-agent-skill-acme"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = ["mcp", "httpx", "prime-agent-runtime"]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/acme"]
```

`src/acme/__init__.py`:

```python
from rlm import McpIntegration

class Acme(McpIntegration):
    server = "acme"                      # matches the mcpServers key / auth.json `mcp:acme`
    url = "https://mcp.acme.com/mcp"

acme = Acme()

# Forward bare module access (`import acme; await acme.<tool>(...)`) to the
# instance, but NOT the names the kernel bootstrap probes — forwarding `run`
# would make it treat the module as a callable skill and break tool dispatch.
_RESERVED = {"run", "__wrapped__", "__call__"}

def __getattr__(name):
    if name.startswith("_") or name in _RESERVED:
        raise AttributeError(name)
    return getattr(acme, name)
```

The base class resolves the configured transport from the host. For HTTP it
connects with the `mcp` SDK, resolves URL/headers, injects the bearer token from
`auth.json` (refreshing when expired), and binds the server's tools as async
methods. For host-managed stdio it keeps command, arguments, environment, and
cwd in the host and dispatches `list_tools` / `call_tool` through the host
bridge. Authoring is a few lines — the package above is the whole integration.

### Authentication

- **OAuth** (`"oauth": true`): the user runs `/login` → MCP Connections → your server (or
  `/mcp login acme`). Works when the server supports OAuth 2.1 dynamic client
  registration (RFC 7591); login discovers the auth server, registers a client,
  and runs PKCE. Servers requiring a pre-registered client id are not yet
  supported via `mcpServers`.
- **Static bearer token** (`"bearerTokenEnvVar": "ACME_TOKEN"`): no login needed;
  the integration is "connected" whenever that env var is set. Set the matching
  `bearer_token_env = "ACME_TOKEN"` on the subclass.

## The `McpIntegration` API

Imported from `rlm` (`from rlm import McpIntegration`).

Class attributes to set on your subclass:

- `server: str` — required; the `mcpServers` key and `auth.json` credential id.
- `url: str | None` — the remote endpoint (required unless you override
  `_open_session` for a non-HTTP transport).
- `bearer_token_env: str | None` — optional env var holding a static bearer token.

Methods:

- `await list_tools() -> list[dict]` — the server's tools as
  `[{name, description, inputSchema}]`. Also populates the docstrings shown by
  `help(integration.<tool>)`.
- `await call_tool(name, arguments={}) -> Any` — explicit call; the escape hatch
  for non-identifier tool names.
- `integration.<tool>(**kwargs)` — auto-bound async method for any discovered tool.

Exceptions (both importable from `rlm`):

- `NotEnabled` — raised when no usable credentials exist (not logged in).
- `Disabled` — raised when an integration is explicitly disabled.
- `McpToolError` — raised when a tool call returns a result flagged as an error.

## Enable-by-login lifecycle

This auth-gating applies to the **built-in** integrations (Linear, Notion):

1. The built-in skill ships installed but **disabled** — excluded from the prompt
   and not imported into the kernel — because no credentials exist.
2. The user logs in; credentials land in `auth.json` under `mcp:<server>`.
3. A resource reload (automatic after `/login`/`/mcp login`, or `/reload`) detects
   the credentials, enables the skill, and the kernel installs + imports the
   package.
4. Logout (or losing credentials) disables it again.

If you log in mid-turn, the reload is deferred — run `/reload` after the turn to
activate the integration.

**User-authored integrations are not auth-gated this way.** A skill you drop into
a skills directory is loaded like any other skill — visible to the model and
imported into the kernel immediately, regardless of `auth.json`. It simply fails
at call time with `NotEnabled` until credentials exist. So make the skill's
`SKILL.md` tell the model how to connect when a call raises `NotEnabled`, matching
the auth mode you configured:

- **OAuth** (`"oauth": true`): instruct the user to run `/mcp login <server>` (or
  `/login` → MCP Connections). `/mcp login` only works for OAuth servers.
- **Bearer token** (`bearerTokenEnvVar`): instruct the user to set that env var —
  do *not* point them at `/mcp login`, which has no provider for a bearer-only
  server and reports "Unknown MCP integration".

## Optional local sidecars

The bundled `jcodemunch` and `context-mode` skills target separately installed
sidecars for structured code retrieval and bounded large-output processing.
The skills are available by default, while the sidecars remain separately
installed and optional. When no user `mcpServers` entry overrides either name,
Prime Agent resolves `jcodemunch` to the `jcodemunch-mcp` command and
`context-mode` to the `context-mode` command as lazy host-managed stdio
integrations. Importing either package never installs, launches, indexes,
upgrades, or purges a sidecar; `available()` reports diagnostics when a command
is missing.

### Host-managed stdio

Install the sidecar separately if you want to use it. The following explicit
configuration is equivalent to Prime Agent's defaults and is useful when you
need to add args, env, cwd, tool filters, or an explicit `enabled` setting:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jcodemunch": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "jcodemunch-mcp"
    },
    "context-mode": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "context-mode"
    }
  }
}
```

To disable one default without disabling the other, keep its required command
and set `enabled` to `false`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jcodemunch": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "jcodemunch-mcp",
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

The host launches configured stdio servers lazily and keeps their command,
arguments, environment, and working directory host-side; the Python skill
uses the host bridge for `list_tools` and `call_tool`. Implicit defaults enforce
the same curated tool surfaces as the bundled skills for both operations. A user
entry replaces the matching default, including its transport and tool filters;
`{ "enabled": false }` disables it without falling back to an environment URL.
Do not add undocumented arguments or put secret values in a skill or diagnostic.
For another sidecar whose CLI
syntax is not known, use a safe placeholder and confirm its docs before
enabling it:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acme": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/separately-installed-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Streamable HTTP

Configure an HTTP endpoint in `mcpServers` (or the documented skill-specific
`*_MCP_URL` environment variable). The endpoint and token names below are
examples rather than sidecar defaults:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jcodemunch": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://localhost.example/jcodemunch/mcp",
      "bearerTokenEnvVar": "JCODEMUNCH_MCP_TOKEN"
    },
    "context-mode": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://localhost.example/context-mode/mcp",
      "bearerTokenEnvVar": "CONTEXT_MODE_MCP_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

The Python adapters open an HTTP session only for an HTTP configuration; they
do not launch or attach to stdio themselves. Context Mode exposes a deliberate
allowlist for execution, file processing, batch processing, fetch-and-index,
and search. It blocks `ctx_purge`, `ctx_upgrade`, and other maintenance tools.
Review the separately installed jCodeMunch sidecar's license terms before use;
the bundled skill does not include or copy that sidecar. Neither skill
automatically installs, upgrades, reindexes, removes, or purges a sidecar.

## Caveats

- **Discover before assuming.** Tool names and argument schemas come from the
  server and can change; call `list_tools()` / `help()` rather than hardcoding.
- **Custom kernel + name collisions.** The kernel import name is the `server`
  value. On a custom `PRIME_AGENT_KERNEL_PYTHON` that already has an unrelated PyPI
  package of the same name (e.g. `notion`), `import <name>` may resolve to that
  package instead. Use the default managed kernel venv to avoid this.
- **Overriding a built-in name.** Declaring an `mcpServers` entry whose key matches
  a built-in (e.g. `linear`) with a custom `url` points the integration at your
  URL. A previously stored official credential is *not* reused for the override, to
  avoid sending the official token to your endpoint. Authenticate such an override
  via `bearerTokenEnvVar` only — OAuth credentials are not honored for a
  catalog-name override. (Use a name that isn't a built-in to get OAuth.)
- **Multi-session daemon.** OAuth provider registration is process-global; a
  user-declared server unique to one daemon session is re-registered on that
  session's next reload.
- **Stdio lifecycle.** Local sidecars are owned by the session's host manager,
  started on first use, serialized per server, and stopped on reload/disposal.
